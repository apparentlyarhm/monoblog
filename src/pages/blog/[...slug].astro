      A small disclaimer: if you are reading this, and want to comment on anything, you'd have to reach out directly. 
      this platform is still in its infancy and im yet to add all the "social" features; I also highly doubt my content would 
      be engaging enough anyway to spark engagement but you never know when people want to discuss something, or, .... hate lol
