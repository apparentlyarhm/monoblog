# What's this?

This is a test of the **monoblog** system, where we build mds by building the astro app then let go serve the files
<br></br>
I was just fucking around with gemini to brainstorm to somehow use my spare laptop as a blog reserve, and it suggested this approach, which is not too shabby and honestly unlike anything ive worked with. interesting. 

## Why Go + Astro?
Because why not?

**NOTE:** this is my first look at astro, like ever.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("wow md out of the box")
}
